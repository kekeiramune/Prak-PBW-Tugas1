Install Git on Windows
1. Navigate to the latest Git for Windows installer and download the latest version.
2. Once the installer has started, follow the instructions as provided in the Git Setup wizard screen until the installation is complete.
3. Open the windows command prompt (or Git Bash if you selected not to use the standard Git Windows Command Prompt during the Git installation).
4. Type git version to verify Git was installed.
Note: git-scm is a popular and recommended resource for downloading Git for Windows. The advantage of downloading Git from git-scm is that your download automatically starts with the latest version of Git included with the recommended command prompt, Git Bash . The download source is the same Git for Windows installer as referenced in the steps above.
